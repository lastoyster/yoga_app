    answer:
      "It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English."

    feedback:
      "I will be very straightforward - I hate sports and working out. <b>Positive Yoga</b> put my physical activity to the next level. I started to enjoy my morning yoga routines where I get my dose of cardio, resistance, and stretching in one place. I could barely hold a plank at the beginning. Now I’m doing various yoga poses that looked impossible at first. My body shape improved a lot and I am very motivated by both: results and the feeling of progress."

      "I have many friends who practice yoga and I decided to try it myself. It is the best decision I have made in a long time. With <b>Positive Yoga</b> program I started to lose weight, which was demotivating me for a long time. Also, I’ve learned about yoga philosophy and poses that encourage me to practice mindfulness and pay attention to stress reduction. I am very proud of myself. Feeling better is my biggest motivation."
